# What is an Algorithm?
A programming algorithm is a procedure or formula used for solving a problem. It is based on conducting a sequence of specified actions in which these actions describe how to do something,
and your computer will do it exactly that way every time.

#  How to solve them?
To solve an algorithm, you have first of all to think about it, analyze it, and ask around to think with you. It's a common mistake to start coding right away with solving algorithms.
Don't code before you have a plan.
In the end, you will be stuck in trying something you don't understand.

# How do I start?
## T-Diagrams 
It's a table representation of an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of elements and variables that are 
connected among  the algorithms to indicate the flow of information and find the solution for it. 

## Pseudocode
It is a methodology that allows the programmer to represent the implementation of an algorithm.
Write your steps for the algorithm's solution as a comment and explain what are you going  to do to reach the result that you want.

## Coding
After you finish the previous steps, you can start coding depending on information from your
Diagram and pseudocode 



## Algorithm challenges
Algorithm challenges are effective because there is more than one way to solve them.
This opens the possibility for decisions to be made and the calculus of those decisions. 
When solving an algorithm problem, we should challenge ourselves to look at the problem definition from multiple perspectives, then weigh the benefits and demerits of various approaches.
With enough practice, we might even glimpse a universal truth: there’s no “perfect” solution.
